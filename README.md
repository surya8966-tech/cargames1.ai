## Code Structure

The game is organized into clear sections:

1. **Constants & Settings**: Game dimensions, colors, speeds
2. **Player Class**: Handles player car movement and rendering
3. **Obstacle Class**: Manages enemy cars and their behavior
4. **Game Class**: Main game logic, collision detection, scoring
5. **Main Function**: Game initialization and error handling

## Customization Ideas

Want to modify the game? Here are some beginner-friendly changes:

- **Change Colors**: Modify the color constants at the top
- **Adjust Speed**: Change `PLAYER_SPEED` or `OBSTACLE_SPEED`
- **Screen Size**: Modify `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT`
- **Spawn Rate**: Change `OBSTACLE_SPAWN_RATE` (lower = more obstacles)
- **Car Sizes**: Adjust `PLAYER_WIDTH`, `PLAYER_HEIGHT`, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "pygame is not installed" Error
Run: `pip install pygame`

### "python is not recognized" Error
Make sure Python is added to your system PATH during installation

### Game Runs Too Fast/Slow
Modify the `FPS` constant (default is 60)

### Performance Issues
Try reducing the screen size or FPS if the game runs slowly
